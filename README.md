Hi friends! Welcome, grab some popcorn and enjoy your stay in my portfolio. 

## About Me 🚀

Hey there! I'm Laura Buibas, a tech enthusiast hailing from New York 🗽. With a knack for turning data into insights and code into solutions, I'm on a mission to dive deep and uncover hidden data gems 💎! From SQL sorcery to Python wizardry, I've got the tools to sprinkle some magic into your data analytics to turn data into insights and ideas into action 🚀. When I'm not busy crunching numbers, you can find me whipping up culinary creations 🍳, hitting the dance floor 💃, or exploring my city's hidden gems 🌆. Let's connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laura-buibas) and geek out over data together 😄.

While you're here, please check out my portfolio. This repository showcases my public projects in the field of data analysis, covering a variety of tools and techniques. Here you'll find a collection of my public work, including Python projects, Tableau visualizations, SQL projects (coming soon), and more.
